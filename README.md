# A website I'm rebuilding for my mom


This is an ongoing project, but is currently haulted in favor of other more pressing work. However, v1 of the site is nearly finished. It is built using the following technologies

- ** Gatsbyjs for all front-end logic/layouts
- ** SCSS pre-processing for DRYer code and cool effects
- ** 100% custom stylesheets/design
- ** Strapi Headless CMS for backend bootstrapping, with a bit of a custom interface
